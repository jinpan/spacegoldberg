                <p>The Earth is dying. Humanity has used up much of her resources, and the Sun is bloating into a red giant that will soon consume the Earth. It is time to move onward to a new Solar System. You are the leader of the last group of humans, whose hope lies in you and your ability to pilot the last spaceship to a new home.</p>

                <p>Humanity has discovered a new technology. They call it the bender. By warping space time, the bender can transport spaceships across large distances in the galaxy. Unfortunately, the bender can only work if it is a considerable distance from any other large bodies of matter.</p>

                <p>With the lack of resources on Earth, there is not enough fuel of any kind to push your spaceship filled with the last of humanity far enough out of the solar system to use the bender. Some of your engineers believe that there is a way to escape the solar system on the current amount of fuel. They explain that some of the early space missions led by humanity used mysterious techniques to help their spaceships reach distant planets with much less fuel than would have been required to fly directly there. However, none of them know exactly how this was done . . . </p>
